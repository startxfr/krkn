###  Delete Namespace Scenarios

Using this type of scenario configuration one is able to delete a specific namespace, or a namespace matching a certain regex string.

Configuration Options:

**namespace:** Specific namespace or regex style namespace of what you want to delete. Gets all namespaces if not specified; set to "" if you want to use the label_selector field.

Set to '^.*$' and label_selector to "" to randomly select any namespace in your cluster.

**label_selector:** Label on the namespace you want to delete. Set to "" if you are using the namespace variable.

**delete_count:** Number of namespaces to kill in each run. Based on matching namespace and label specified, default is 1.

**runs:** Number of runs/iterations to kill namespaces, default is 1.

**sleep:** Number of seconds to wait between each iteration/count of killing namespaces. Defaults to 10 seconds if not set

Refer to [namespace_scenarios_example](https://github.com/redhat-chaos/krkn/blob/main/scenarios/regex_namespace.yaml) config file.

```
scenarios:
- namespace: "^.*$"
  runs: 1
- namespace: "^.*ingress.*$"
  runs: 1
  sleep: 15
```

**NOTE:** Many openshift namespaces have finalizers built that protect the namespace from being fully deleted: see documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/05/14/using-finalizers-to-control-deletion/).
The namespaces that do have finalizers enabled will be in left in a terminating state but all the pods running on that namespace will get deleted.

#### Post Action

In all scenarios we do a post chaos check to wait and verify the specific component.

Here there are two options:

1. Pass a custom script in the main config scenario list that will run before the chaos and verify the output matches post chaos scenario.

See [scenarios/post_action_namespace.py](https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken/tree/master/scenarios/post_action_namespace.py) for an example

```
-   namespace_scenarios:
     - -    scenarios/regex_namespace.yaml
       -    scenarios/post_action_namespace.py
```


2. Allow kraken to wait and check the killed namespaces become 'Active' again. Kraken keeps a list of the specific
namespaces that were killed to verify all that were affected recover properly.

```
wait_time: <seconds to wait for namespace to recover>
```
