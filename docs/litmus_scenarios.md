### Litmus Scenarios
Kraken consumes [Litmus](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus) under the hood for some scenarios

Official Litmus documentation and specifics of Litmus resources can be found [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/next/getstarted/)


#### Litmus Chaos Custom Resources
There are 3 custom resources that are created during each Litmus scenario. Below is a description of the resources:
* ChaosEngine: A resource to link a Kubernetes application or Kubernetes node to a ChaosExperiment. ChaosEngine is watched by Litmus' Chaos-Operator which then invokes Chaos-Experiments.
* ChaosExperiment: A resource to group the configuration parameters of a chaos experiment. ChaosExperiment CRs are created by the operator when experiments are invoked by ChaosEngine.
* ChaosResult : A resource to hold the results of a chaos-experiment. The Chaos-exporter reads the results and exports the metrics into a configured Prometheus server.

### Understanding Litmus Scenarios

To run Litmus scenarios we need to apply 3 different resources/yaml files to our cluster.
1. **Chaos experiments** contain the actual chaos details of a scenario.

    i. This is installed automatically by Kraken (does not need to be specified in kraken scenario configuration).

2. **Service Account**: should be created to allow chaosengine to run experiments in your application namespace. Usually it sets just enough permissions to a specific namespace to be able to run the experiment properly.

    i. This can be defined using either a link to a yaml file or a downloaded file in the scenarios' folder.

3. **Chaos Engine** connects the application instance to a Chaos Experiment. This is where you define the specifics of your scenario; i.e.: the node or pod name you want to cause chaos within.

    i. This is a downloaded yaml file in the scenarios' folder. A full list of scenarios can be found [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/)

**NOTE**: By default, all chaos experiments will be installed based on the version you give in the config file.

Adding a new Litmus based scenario is as simple as adding references to 2 new yaml files (the Service Account and Chaos engine files for your scenario ) in the Kraken config.


### Supported scenarios

The following are the start of scenarios for which a chaos scenario config exists today.

Scenario                 | Description                                                                             | Working
------------------------ |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------- |
[Node CPU Hog](https://github.com/redhat-chaos/krkn/blob/main/scenarios/node_cpu_hog_engine.yaml)             | Chaos scenario that hogs up the CPU on a defined node for a specific amount of time.    | :heavy_check_mark:        |
[Node Memory Hog](https://github.com/redhat-chaos/krkn/blob/main/scenarios/node_mem_engine.yaml)          | Chaos scenario that hogs up the memory on a defined node for a specific amount of time. | :heavy_check_mark:        |
[Node IO Hog](https://github.com/redhat-chaos/krkn/blob/main/scenarios/node_io_engine.yaml)                   | Chaos scenario that hogs up the IO on a defined node for a specific amount of time.     | :heavy_check_mark:        |
